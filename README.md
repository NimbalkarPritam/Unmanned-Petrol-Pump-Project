# Unmanned-Petrol-Pump-Project
The proposed system automates petrol pump operations, eliminating the need for attendants by using microcontrollers and GSM technology. It allows users to refuel without cash, offers 24/7 service, and provides safety alerts. Users receive a password via mobile for authentication before fuel is dispensed, ensuring security and convenience.
